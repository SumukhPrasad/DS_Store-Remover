# Remove .DS_Store (Desktop Services Store)

On macOS, .DS_Store is a file that stores custom attributes of its containing folder, such as the position of icons or the choice of a background image. Finder creates this file in every folder, and will not display it (even with `com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles YES` set).

This is a small utility I made to remove all these files from a folder.
